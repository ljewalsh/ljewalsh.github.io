Over five years ago, working as an archivist as the Univeristy of Canterbury, my manager linked me to the website <a href="http://codecademy.com">codecademy</a> with a vague comment of "you might like this". I still remember the homepage - a signup form with an embedded terminal next to it and a message employing me to write my first line of code: <i>print 'hello world'</i>. Quickly I typed those three words, hit enter, and watched the terminal dutifly spitout out its message for me.

<center>hello world</center>

I was hooked.

In the months that followed it became increasingly clear to me that I wanted to make software my job. Whenever I worked with code, whether that making my way through a tutorial, building a little project, or hacking things my team used, I lost all awareness of time - hours passed by like minutes, lunchbreaks were missed, I found it hard to go home at the end of the day, sure that the solution to whatever problem I was working on was right around the corner. My job no longer felt like work. I loved what I was doing.

Over the next few years I managed to morph my archive job into a technical role but it wasn't until 2017 that I was able to make the leap from an English grad with some technical skills to a real-life bonified software engineer. I sometimes think now about those times, and about all the things I wish I had known at the time - small things I could have done to speed up the process of becoming a dev. Overtime I have curated and polished this list into something resembling tips for self-taught
developers. I hope that these will be useful for other people who are looking to make the same journey that I once did.
