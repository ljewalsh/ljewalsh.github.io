I"½<p>So I thought it was time to start a blog. Iâ€™m learning so much in my day-to-day job that it seems silly not to share it with the world.</p>

<p>Some things about meâ€¦</p>

<ul>
<li>I am a self-taught programmer with a degree in English literature. Like many woman in the industry I didn't realise I liked coding until after I had graduated. Sometimes this makes me feel like I've fallen behind my fellow coders and other times I feel like I gained a lot from studying what I did. Perhaps a post for another day?</li>

<li>When I'm not coding, you can find me rock climbing, tramping, or reading and writing science fiction.</li>

<li>This year I founded a science fiction magazine called <a href="http://sponge.nz">Sponge</a> which publishes short fiction from NZ and Pacific writers.</li>

<li>I work for a startup called <a href="http://www.mish.guru">Mish Guru</a>, helping to build their Snapchat management and analytics platform. We work in an open-plan workspace in town and have colleagues all over the world.
</li>

<li>I have two adorable burmese cats named Vienna and Ash.</li>

<li>I am terrible at updating blogs!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s hope I can fix that last one.</p>

<p>Over and out!</p>
